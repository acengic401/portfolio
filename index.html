        <h3>CIS 150</h3>
<p>
This course provides an overview of contemporary information systems, and how they are used in organizations. It presents an introduction to the discipline of CIS and how information systems can be used to create competitive advantage. Topics include application/web development, including the system development life cycle, information security, business process management, and emerging technologies. Students will develop basic web sites including the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
 </p>
<p>
In the document below, I have attached some of the websites that I created that demonstrate the use of CSS, Javacript, and HTML. The first website was created for a biking tour and it displays the itinerary for the upcoming biking tour. The second website was created for an upcoming event called the Tulsa Party and it displays a countdown as well as general information about the party.
