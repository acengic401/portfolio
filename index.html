        <h3>CIS 150: Fundamentals of Information Systems</h3>
<p>
This course provides an overview of contemporary information systems, and how they are used in organizations. It presents an introduction to the discipline of CIS and how information systems can be used to create competitive advantage. Topics include application/web development, including the system development life cycle, information security, business process management, and emerging technologies.
 </p>
<p>
In the document below, I have attached some of the websites that I created that demonstrate the use of CSS, Javacript, and HTML. The first website was created for a biking tour and it displays the itinerary for the upcoming biking tour. The second website was created for an upcoming event called the Tulsa Party and it displays a countdown as well as general information about the party.

        <h3>CIS 199: Software Development I</h3>

<p>This course introduces object-oriented concepts such as the use of classes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance. The course concentrates on using object-oriented programming to solve simple problems involving input and output.

Below, I have attached screenshots of some of the C# applications that I created in this class. 

In the first assignment, I created a console application that would calculate the materials and labor costs for a carpet sales and installation company. This assignment required the use of variable and simple arithmetic. </p>
<p>In the second assignment, I created a GUI application that would calculate income taxes based on different income brackets. This assignment required the use of decision-making logic.

      </p>
 

        <h3>CIS 200: Software Development II</h3>

<p>This course was a continuation of CIS 199 and it delved deeper into object-oriented software development concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, object interaction, and data structures. 

In the first program, I created a simple class hierarchy for package delivery services in order to calculate the cost of shipping individual items based on the shipping address and weight of the package. I used object oriented programming concepts such composition and inheritance in this application. </p>
<p>In the second program, I generated reports that sorted parcels based on their destination zip code, shipping costs, and weight. I used LINQ in order to create these queries.

<p>In both of these assignments, I created tables and graphs in Excel and Access that visually represent the monthly revenues of different items of two different companies. In the second assignment, I calculated the monthly interest payments of a new truck.  


      </p>

 <h3>CIS 310: Database Design</h3>

<p>This course lays a solid and practical foundation for the design and implementation of database systems using SQL Server. 
In the first assignment, I created business rules, an ERD, and identified the primary and foreign keys for an employee database. 

 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQFe4BjvNyg05xNOqZfOzbgOpkoPkOTfkZtsF_UXB2u8FldI8zVCTcUseQpV7I0FQ/pub">CIS 310 Link 1</a> </p>

<p>In the second assignment, I created several queries in SQL that would return specific books in a based on certain attributes.

      </p>
 <h3>CIS 320: Systems Analysis and Design</h3>

<p>This course introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented analysis and design in a team setting. Topics include requirements determination, feasibility analysis, and modeling with Unified Modeling Language (UML).

The first assignment is a set of important deliverable that my team and I created for our system. It includes use case specifications, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and prototypes.

<h3>CIS 350: Infrastructure Technology</h3>

<p>This course provides an introduction to IT infrastructure issues and covers topics related to computer and systems architecture and communication networks. Assignments require the use of CMD and Unix/Linux. 

The first assignment was a lab that I used CMD and required the use of several commands such as echo, pause, erase, and cd.
